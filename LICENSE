We are posting early drafts of our Static Analysis Results Interchange Format
(SARIF) specification for review, comments, and input. **Since your input might
be subject to intellectual property rights, some basic obligations apply:** 

In general, we want to ensure that we can use all input (through this site or
otherwise) freely in the development of the specification, so it’s essential
that those who contribute at this stage agree not to claim that the
specification infringes their copyrights, or that an implementation of the
specification infringes their patent rights. We also want to ensure that this
draft is the definitive version, and that copies or modified versions aren’t
being circulated elsewhere. 

Specifically:

* If you provide input that is subject to copyright, you must own (or have
  sufficient rights) to make the contribution, and you and your employer agree
  that we may use the contribution freely worldwide (copy, modify, transform,
  create derivative works, redistribute, etc.) without restrictions or
  obligations (no attribution, accounting, royalties, and so on). If your
  contribution is owned by someone else and you’re making the contribution
  under license, please identify the owner.

* If you provide input that would infringe any patent claims if implemented in
  the specification, you and your employer and its affiliates agree that
  implementers of the specification will not be subject to claims of patent
  infringement for claims owned or controlled by them; this applies only to
  elements that are set forth in detail in the specification (e.g., not to
  normative references or enabling technologies), and only if there is no
  non-infringing alternative; it also applies to future versions so long as the
  substantive nature of the infringement is unchanged.
   
* Except for the purpose of providing input to us regarding the draft, the
  draft specification may not be copied, modified, or redistributed.
 
Since we are relying on your input and want to ensure that the project is not
hobbled by legal claims, these commitments are permanent and may not be
retracted.
