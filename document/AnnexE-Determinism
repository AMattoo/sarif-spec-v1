# Annex E (informative) Producing deterministic SARIF log files { - #Annex-E }

## General { - #Annex-E-General }

In certain circumstances, it is desirable for an analysis tool to produce deterministic output;
that is, for it to produce identical output when run repeatedly over identical inputs.

Certain build systems provide an example of when this is desirable.
Consider a build system that caches the results of each build step.
If the build is rerun, and the inputs to the step are identical
(which the build system might determine, for example, by comparing timestamps,
or by computing a hash of the inputs to the step and storing it along with the output from the step),
then the build system can save time by not re-running the step, and simply
using the existing outputs.

In the case of SARIF, one could imagine a sequence of build steps where Steps A
B, and C each run an analysis tool on a different set of targets, producing log files
A.sarif, B.sarif, and C.sarif, and then build Step D performs an analysis on the aggregate
of those log files. If the targets analyzed in Step B change
but the targets analyzed in steps A and C do not, and if the contents of the
SARIF log file are deterministic, then when the build is re-run, only Steps B and D
need be performed.

Authors of analysis tools are encouraged to provide a mechanism
(for example, a command line option such as `--deterministic`) which instructs the tool to
produce deterministic output.

There are several issues to consider when producing deterministic output:

* Avoiding elements of the SARIF file format whose values are non-deterministic.
* Emitting array and dictionary elements in a deterministic order.
* Avoiding absolute paths.
* Emitting case-insensitive string values with deterministic casing.
* Handling baseline information.

## Non-deterministic file format elements { - #Annex-E-Elements }

For a tool to produce deterministic output, it should not emit the following elements
of the SARIF format. All of these elements are optional.

Not all of these elements are non-deterministic in all cases.
For example, some build systems might run all builds on the same machine or under the same account.
However, avoiding these elements, in conjunction with the techniques described in subsequent
sections of this Annex, guarantees deterministic output.

* `invocation.startTime`
* `invocation.endTime`
* `invocation.processId`
* `invocation.machine`
* `invocation.account`
* `invocation.fileName` (because `fileName` is specified as being an absolute path, and
tools might be stored in different directories on different machines)
* `invocation.workingDirectory`
* `invocation.environmentVariables`
* The use of absolute file paths in `invocation.commandLine`
(because builds performed on different machines might use a different root directory)
* `annotatedCodeLocation.threadId`
* `notification.threadId`
* `notification.time`
* `run.id`
* `run.automationId`
* `run.baselineId`
* `stackFrame.threadId`
* `stackFrame.address` (because security measures such as address space layout randomization (ASLR)
might place identical code at different addresses from run to run)
* The presence of any non-deterministic elements in a property bag property

## Array and dictionary element ordering { - #Annex-E-Ordering }

For a tool to produce deterministic output, it must emit array and dictionary elements
in a deterministic order.

For some arrays, the SARIF format requires a specific ordering.
For example, within the `stack.Frames` property, SARIF requires the `annotatedCodeLocation` object
representing the most deeply nested function call to appear first.

For other arrays, the SARIF format does not require a specific ordering.
For example, within the `file.hashes` property, SARIF does not require the `hash` objects
to appear in any particular order.
For such arrays, a tool can ensure the order by sorting the array elements before
writing them to the log file.
For example, it might sort the `hash` objects alphabetically by the string value of the
`hash.algorithm` property.

A tool might similarly choose to emit the string elements of a `properties.tags` array in
locale-insensitive alphabetical order.

The array of `result` objects presents more of a problem.
A multi-threaded analysis tool analyzing multiple files in parallel might produce results
in any order, and there is no natural order for the results.
A tool might choose to order them, for example, first alphabetically by analysis target URI,
then numerically by line number, then by column number, then alphabetically by rule id.

For dictionaries such as the `run.rules` object or the `run.files` object,
a tool might order the property names alphabetically, using a locale-insensitive ordering.

## Absolute paths { - #Annex-E-AbsolutePaths }

The use of absolute file paths in URI-valued properties such as `physicalLocation.uri`
makes it difficult to produce deterministic output.
For example:

* Different build machines might be configured to use different source directories.
* A single build machine might use a different directory for each build.

For a tool to produce deterministic output, it must avoid the use of absolute file paths.
Tools can achieve this by emitting URIs that are relative to one or more root directories
(for example, a source root directory and an output root directory),
and accompanying each URI-valued property with a URI base id property (&sect;[#fileFormat-uriBaseIdProperties]). 

## Case-insensitive file format elements { - #Annex-E-Case }

Case-insensitive file systems can also cause non-deterministic output.
Suppose a URI-valued property contains a file path from a file system that is
case-preserving but case-insensitive (such as NTFS):

```
"uri": "file:///C:/Code/File1.c"
```

Suppose the file is then renamed to `file.c`. NTFS treats `File1.c` and `file1.c` as the same file.
But a subsequent run of the tool might produce

```
"uri": "file:///C:/Code/file1.c"
```

A tool might choose to ignore this issue, since this would happen rarely, and the only
consequence of ignoring it is that a subsequent step in a build process might execute
even though it does not strictly have to.

To produce absolutely deterministic output, the tool might instead choose to convert all
file paths to lowercase or to uppercase, using a locale-insensitive case conversion:

```
"uri": "file:///C:/code/file1.c"
```

~IsoNote

On the .NET platform, the recommendation is to convert strings to uppercase
using the method `String.ToUpperInvariant`, which would result in:

```
"uri": "file:///C:/CODE/FILE1.C"
```

## Compensating for non-deterministic output { - #Annex-E-Compensating }

If an analysis tool does not produce deterministic output,
a build system can add additional processing steps to compensate.

There are two scenarios to consider:

1. Log equality is determined by a simple comparison of file contents, or by comparing file hashes.
2. Log equality is determined by an "intelligent" comparison.

In the first scenario, a post-processing step could
produce deterministic output by removing non-deterministic elements,
reordering array elements and object properties,
removing file path prefixes and introducing `uriBaseId` properties,
and adjusting the casing of case-insensitive string values.

In the second scenario, a post-processing step could intelligently compare the newly produced log
to the log from a previous build by ignoring non-deterministic elements,
ensuring that arrays have the same elements regardless of order,
ignoring file path prefixes,
and performing a case-insensitive comparison.

## Interaction between determinism and baselining { - #Annex-E-Baselining }

SARIF's baselining feature poses a particular challenge for determinism.
We illustrate the problem with the following scenario:

On a particular date, a project's nightly build runs an analysis tool ToolX,
which produces a log file, say, `log_20160614.sarif`.
The next day, a developer modifies one of the files scanned by the tool
in a way that introduces a new problem.
That night, the nightly build tool runs again, this time producing a log file which
compares the current set of results to those that appeared in the previous run:
```
ToolX --input a.c b.c --baseline log_20160614.sarif --output log_20160615.sarif
```
Because a new problem has been introduced, `log_20160614.sarif` will contain a `result` object
whose `baselineState` is `"new"`.
The next night, without any further changes to the source files, the tool is run yet again:
```
ToolX --input a.c b.c --baseline log_20160615.sarif --output log_20160616.sarif
```
The `result` object that first appeared in `log_20160615.sarif` still appears in `log_20160616.sarif`,
but since it existed in the baseline, its `baselineState` will now be `"existing"`.

The result is that even though none of the analysis target files have changed,
the log file has changed.

Strictly speaking, this does not violate determinism. After all, the baseline file has changed,
and the baseline file is one of the inputs to the analysis.
But from a practical standpoint, this is still a problem, because... why?
