# Policy Compliance Profile { #policy-compliance-profile }

## General { #policy-compliance-profile-general }

It is sometimes desirable to use the output of an analysis tool to help determine
whether a project is in compliance with applicable policies.
For example, a policy might state that "the code shall contain no null-dereference errors."
To determine whether their code base complies with this policy,
a team might run a tool that includes a rule that checks for null-dereference errors,
and then examine the run log.
The fact that the run log contains no results that violate this policy is not
sufficient to determine compliance.
The team must also be able to verify that the tool actually ran the necessary rule.

The Policy Compliance Profile defines additional optional elements of the SARIF format
that are intended for use in this scenario.

## `run` object { #policy-compliance-profile-run }

The Policy Compliance Profile defines one additional property on the `run` object (&sect;[#run]).

### `compliance` property { #run-compliance }

A `run` object (&sect;[#run]) may contain a property named `compliance`
whose value is a `compliance` object (&sect;[#compliance]).

## `compliance` object { #compliance }

### General { #compliance-general }

A `compliance` object contains information that helps determine whether the
tool producing the log was configured in a way that complies with applicable policies.

A `compliance` object is not a policy or statement of policy.
It is merely a collection of information that helps determine policy compliance.

### `enabledRules` property { #compliance-enabledRules }

A `compliance` object
shall contain a property named `enabledRules` whose value is an array
of zero or more `configuredRule` objects (&sect;[#configuredRule]).

## `configuredRule` object { #configuredRule }

### General { #configuredRule-general }

An `configuredRule` object specifies a rule that the analysis tool was configured
to execute for the run described by the current `run` (&sect;[#run]).
The `run` need not contain any `result` objects (&sect;[#result]) for this rule,
and indeed it will not if the tool detected no violations of the rule.
The purpose of the `configuredRule` object is to allow verification that the tool
was correctly configured with the appropriate set of rules.

### `ruleId` property { #configuredRule-ruleId }

An `configuredRule` object shall contain a property named `ruleId` whose value is a string
containing the stable, unique identifier for a rule that the tool was configured to run.

No two `configuredRule` objects in the same `compliance` object (&sect;[#compliance])
shall have the same `ruleId`.

~ IsoNote
Not all tools associate a unique rule id with each rule that they execute.
The Policy Compliance Profile is not compatible with such tools.
